   <!--
    - All of the styling for this toggle behavior revolves around adding and
    _ removing the toggle class from the parent element. In this example, we use
    _ the toggle class "read_more" on the element "div.read_more_container".
    _ This causes - the elements "button.show_more" and "div.more_text" to
    _ toggle accordingly.
     
    - All of these selectors and classes can be replaced with whatever you want
    - to use. You can even do this with multiple elements all over the page.
    - If you have multiple uses of this, make sure that you either use different
    - parent elements or different toggle class names.
